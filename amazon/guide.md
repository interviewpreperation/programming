# Guide

## Overall
Got it! Since the interview will involve coding and ML knowledge but isn’t a traditional MLE/SDE role (and isn’t Leetcode-heavy), here’s how to prepare effectively:

### 1. **Brush Up on Core ML Concepts**
   - Be ready to explain/discuss:
     - Supervised vs. unsupervised learning, common algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, SVM, neural networks).
     - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision/recall, AUC-ROC, MSE, etc.).
     - Overfitting/underfitting and regularization (L1/L2, dropout, early stopping).
     - Feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
     - Basic deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, transformers) if relevant to the role.
   - Practice explaining these *concisely* with examples.

### 2. **Coding for ML Problems**
   - Focus on *practical* ML coding, not abstract algorithms:
     - Write clean, efficient code for tasks like:
       - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding).
       - Implementing a simple ML model (e.g., logistic regression or k-means from scratch or using `sklearn`).
       - Debugging/tweaking model performance.
     - Use Python (likely expected) and libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`.
   - Be ready for pseudocode or whiteboarding if asked to design a high-level solution.

### 3. **Problem-Solving Approach**
   - Interviewers will care about *how* you solve problems:
     - Clarify the problem upfront (ask questions!).
     - Break it into smaller steps (e.g., data → model → evaluation).
     - Discuss trade-offs (e.g., model complexity vs. interpretability).
     - Iterate (e.g., "First I’d try X, then Y if accuracy is low").

### 4. **Algorithmic Thinking (Light)**
   - Expect lighter algorithmic questions, e.g.:
     - Basic data structures (arrays, dicts) for efficient data handling.
     - Recursion/iteration for simple tasks (e.g., traversing trees for decision rules).
     - Time/space complexity discussion for your ML code.

### 5. **Behavioral/Communication**
   - Even non-MLE roles value clarity:
     - Explain your thought process aloud.
     - Be open to feedback/hints (interviewers might guide you).

### 6. **What *Not* to Do**
   - Don’t grind Leetcode hard (unless you lack coding fluency).
   - Don’t memorize ML theorems—focus on intuition and application.

### Preparation Plan:
- **Daily**: Code 1-2 small ML tasks (e.g., Kaggle tutorials).
- **Mock Interviews**: Practice explaining ML concepts + coding under time limits.
- **Review**: Your past projects—interviewers might ask about them.

Good luck! You’ll do great if you stay structured and practical.


## Specific

If the company focuses on **language models (LMs)**, the interview will likely test your understanding of NLP, practical coding skills for text/data, and problem-solving around real-world LM challenges. Here are common question themes to expect:

---

### **1. Core NLP/LM Concepts**  
Be ready to explain (succinctly!):  
- **Tokenization** (BPE, WordPiece, challenges like multilingual text).  
- **Attention mechanisms** (e.g., how self-attention works in Transformers).  
- **Pretraining vs. fine-tuning** (objectives: masked LM, next-sentence prediction).  
- **Prompting/in-context learning** (zero-shot vs. few-shot).  
- **Efficiency challenges** (memory, latency, quantization for large LMs).  
- **Bias/fairness** in LMs (e.g., toxicity generation, stereotypes).  

**Sample Qs:**  
- *"How would you handle a model that generates biased outputs?"*  
- *"Why does BPE tokenization help with rare words?"*  

---

### **2. Coding Tasks**  
Focus on **text/data manipulation** and **light model implementation**:  
- **Text preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, handling special characters.  
- **Feature extraction**: TF-IDF, n-grams, embeddings (e.g., word2vec).  
- **Implement simple LM components**:  
  - Attention from scratch (simplified).  
  - Beam search for text generation.  
  - Custom loss function (e.g., for sequence alignment).  
- **Debugging**: Fix broken data pipelines or model code.  

**Sample Qs:**  
- *"Write code to count word frequencies, ignoring stopwords."*  
- *"Implement a function to compute Jaccard similarity between two sentences."*  

---

### **3. Problem-Solving/Design**  
Scenarios combining **ML intuition** and **practical trade-offs**:  
- **Data scarcity**: "How would you fine-tune a model with minimal labeled data?"  
- **Deployment**: "How would you reduce inference cost for a billion-parameter LM?"  
- **Evaluation**: "Design metrics to assess a chatbot’s quality beyond accuracy."  
- **Edge cases**: "Your LM fails on non-English text—how do you debug?"  

**Key:** Show structured thinking (clarify constraints → propose solutions → discuss pros/cons).  

---

### **4. Optimization & Efficiency**  
For roles touching inference/training:  
- **Memory/Compute**: Knowledge of distillation, pruning, LoRA.  
- **Hardware-aware**: Batch sizing, GPU utilization.  

**Sample Qs:**  
- *"How would you speed up inference for a Transformer API?"*  

---

### **5. Behavioral/Company Fit**  
- **Past projects**: Be ready to discuss NLP work (even if small).  
- **Ethics**: "How would you address privacy concerns in a chat model?"  

---

### **How to Prepare**  
- **Review**: Transformer architectures (original paper, BERT, GPT), Hugging Face `transformers` library.  
- **Code**: Practice with real text data (e.g., spam detection, text generation).  
- **Think aloud**: Mock interviews with NLP-focused peers.  

**Remember:** They care more about your *approach* than perfect answers. Highlight creativity (e.g., "If data is limited, I’d try X because Y").  

Good luck! You’ve got this.
